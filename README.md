# AWS S3 Service Broker [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudfoundry-community/s3-broker.png)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudfoundry-community/s3-broker)

This is a [Cloud Foundry Service Broker](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/overview.html) for [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

## Installation

### Locally

Using the standard `go install` (you must have [Go](https://golang.org/) already installed in your local machine):

```
$ go install github.com/cloudfoundry-community/s3-broker
$ s3-broker -port=3000 -config=<path-to-your-config-file>
```

### Cloud Foundry

The broker can be deployed to an already existing [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) installation:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/s3-broker.git
$ cd s3-broker
```

Modify the [included manifest file](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/s3-broker/blob/master/manifest.yml) to include your AWS credentials and optionally the [sample configuration file](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/s3-broker/blob/master/config-sample.yml). Then you can push the broker to your [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) environment:

```
$ cp config-sample.yml config.yml
$ cf push s3-broker
```

## Configuration

Refer to the [Configuration](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/s3-broker/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md) instructions for details about configuring this broker.

This broker gets the AWS credentials from the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. It requires a user with some [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) & [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) permissions. Refer to the [iam_policy.json](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/s3-broker/blob/master/iam_policy.json) file to check what actions the user must be allowed to perform.

## Usage

### Managing Service Broker

Configure and deploy the broker using one of the above methods. Then:

1. Check that your Cloud Foundry installation supports [Service Broker API Version v2.6 or greater](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/api.html#changelog)
1. [Register the broker](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/managing-service-brokers.html#register-broker) within your Cloud Foundry installation;
1. [Make Services and Plans public](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/access-control.html#enable-access);
1. Depending on your Cloud Foundry settings, you migh also need to create/bind an [Application Security Group](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html) to allow access to the different cluster caches.

### Integrating Service Instances with Applications

Application Developers can start to consume the services using the standard [CF CLI commands](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html).

#### Binding to multiple instances

If the operator provides credentials for a Cloud Foundry user or client with the `cloud_controller.admin_read_only` scope, users can create application bindings and service keys that grant access to additional service instances in the same Cloud Foundry space. This can be useful for copying files between buckets. 

```sh
cf bind-service my-app my-s3-instance -c '{"additional_instances": ["my-additional-s3-instance"]}'
```
